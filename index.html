								<h2>Coders For Causes</h2>
								<p>Recently I have gone on the committee of a not-for-profit organization called Coders for Causes. I joined their team because I really loved what they were doing;
									helping not-for-profits by connecting student developers with them to solve their problems through the development of software applications.
									Coders for Causes is simultaneously helping two groups of people that require the most help but can’t get it due to their circumstances.
									A redesign of the website can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://fkingnoobgg.github.io/cfc-site-rework/">here</a>

								<h2>Ecommerce store</h2>
								<p>Small e-commerce business I operate. From receiving orders all the way to packaging the item and communicating  with customers.
									There is a lot of competition on eBay as one would expect from an online store however we have managed to remain competitive
									through buying from suppliers in China directly.</p>

								<h2>About</h2>
								<p><i>“Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it.
									Once we truly know that life is difficult-once we truly understand and accept it-then life is no longer difficult.
									Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.”</i> <br />
									~ M. Scott Peck, The Road Less Traveled

									<h3>Goals</h3>
									<p><i>"What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals."</i> <br /> ~ Henry David Thoreau <br /><br/ >
										My short term goals are relatively clear and the main one which takes up most my time right now is to do the best I can in my studies
										at University because by doing so I keep my options open. However my longer term goals are not so clear and only time will tell as to which
										goal I will want to pursue.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-university">
									<h3>Inspiration</h3>
									<p><i>"Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."</i> <br> ~The Serenity Prayer <br> <br>
										Jack Ma's speeches are simply brilliant and he is the reason why I chose to pursue data science. Warren Buffet is another great orator his values also happen
									to be inline with mine (following our passion and the belief that obtaining materialistic goods is frivolous). Finally my idealistic career would be that of Robert F. Smith's.
								</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>Passion</h3>
									<p>There has always been something special about business and programming. I loved both since an early age. (<a href="#">Read about my story</a>)
										It gives me a great sense of statisfaction to write "good code" (I define "good code" as code that is simple, so simple that even an idiot
										would say "hey I could write that").
										Working with people also brings me great joy. I believe it is the close relationships in our lives that bring all the meaning to our lives.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-sun-o">
									<h3>Future</h3>
									<p>I am enjoying my time at university learning new things and making new friends, so an Academic path appears to be favoured route
										at this stage, however I am still very young and inexperienced so I need to go out of my comfort zone to discover new opportunities.
										The future is difficult if not impossible to predict, I am willing to bet money on the fact I will end up doing something I never
									imagined. </p>
