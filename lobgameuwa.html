    The individual with the highest negative number wins for liqudity traders (lowest transaction costs)
    <br><br>
    For each buy trade i, trading costs is: Volume x (TPi - VWAP)
    <br>
    For each sell trades j, trading costs is: Volume x (VWAP - TPj)
    <br><br>
    NOTE: It is assumed that every liquidity trader meets their liquidity requirments
    because we are not given public data of everyone's liquidity requirements.
    <b>Therefore this will never be accurate without the cooperation of all participants
    or UWA business school :(</b>
