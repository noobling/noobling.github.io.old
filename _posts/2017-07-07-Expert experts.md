title: Which Professions Actually have experts?
---

Lets begin the discussion with a question posed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
>Would you rather have your upcoming brain surgery performed by a newspaper's science reporter or by a certified brain surgeon? On the other hand, would you prefer to listen to an economic forecast by someone with a PhD in finance from some "prominent" institution such as Wharton School, or by a newspaper's business writer?

The first question is empirically obvious. The second not so much.

When you pay a so called "expert" high fees only to have an outcome that was unsatisfactory or one that you could have done yourself. One starts to question whether they are even an expert. But if you look at the situation in the expert's eyes it is even more tragic.
They have spent their whole adult life perfecting this craft and they can't even obtain a result that is better than a person who has no clue what their profession is.

So which disciplines actually have experts? And which have none?

The following list of examples have been derived from Nassim's book The Black Swan
Experts who tend to be experts:
* livestock judges
* Astronomers
* Test pilots
* Chess masters
* Physicists
* Chess masters
* Accountants
* Insurance analysts (dealing with bell curve-style statistics/ Gaussian distribution)

Experts who tend to be.... not experts:
* Stockbrokers
* Clinical psychologists
* Psychiatrists
* College admissions officers
* Court judges
* Councilors
* Personnel selectors
* Intelligence analysts
* Economists
* Financial forecasters
* Finance professors
* Political scientists

Of course we cannot provide and exhaustive list for each case but perhaps we could form a general rule for classifying disciplines with experts and those with none (e.g. ones that have no value added).
In Taleb's words
>Professions that deal with the future and base their studies on the non-repeatable past have an expert problem. In other words those who provide no tangible added value are generally dealing with the future

This conclusion sounds reasonable to me after all no one can accurately predict the future with any certainty. As Yogi Berra puts it
>It's tough to make predictions especially about the future
It is unfortunate that some profession require the prediction of the future. So people who work in professions with no experts are no necessarily less intelligent than the rest of the population (although they could be masochists) they have just landed in a field where no one knows the answers.

But what is the implication of all this? Should we just give up on such professions because there exists no value added (note some of the professions that contain no experts also happen to pay large salaries. e.g. stock brokers). Perhaps there exists some value added but it is less noticeable? I do not know the answer but I thought I would pose the question.
