title: Update and plans for 2018
---

It has been a while since I last updated my website, I have been busy due to attending events,spending time with family and friends and taking care of my pets. Also there is something called university. Hopefully I will have more time in 2018 to focus on the things I love doing, programming (building cool applications, working on my own projects, learning what I find interesting and contributing to open source).

In 2018 there are two simple goals that I will set out for myself. **Code everyday** and make one insightful blog post every week and maintain a sort of diary that recalls everything that I learnt for the day.

I also wish to read more but there is just so much to learn in relation to programming and I need to program more to become the best programmer I can be.

Lets make 2018 a productive year!
