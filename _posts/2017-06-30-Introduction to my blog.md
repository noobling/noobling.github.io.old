title: Introduction to my Blog
---

As Aswath Damodaran would put it I am a numbers person not a story teller. I prefer a
a conclusion that is backed up by concrete facts (usually numbers). Similar to
Damodaran I avoided English classes and completed the minimal work although the same
could be said with all my other classes but the truth is I barely passed English
and in fact I nearly failed to get into university because my English scores
were so low.

Therefore I would like to rectify this problem by creating a blog. Hopefully as
I go back and read my blog posts I would be able to see an improvement in my
writing. Also blogging has a nice bonus of helping me
remember the information I learnt. In addition, I hope other people will be able to learn something new as I know I
have learnt a great deal from other's blog posts.
