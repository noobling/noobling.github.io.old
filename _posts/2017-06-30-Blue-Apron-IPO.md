title: Blue-Apron-IPO
---
I stumbled upon this stock while browsing WSB as it peaked my attention due
to the fact that they were poking fun of this stock. As I uncovered more info
about the company the more I agreed with their view. I decided to read their
prospectus [listed here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1701114/000104746917004316/a2232581z424b4.htm)
However we should note that I already had a bias view going into this and perhaps
that may have affected the way I analyzed the prospectus.

Below now I shall go into some detail about the company mixing both fact and opinion
so it would be prudent of you to take note of this.

## Business Summary
>We create original recipes that we develop every week. Our customers can choose the recipes they would like to receive from each week's menu, and we deliver those recipes to their doorsteps along with the pre-portioned ingredients required to cook them.

As of the time of this post they offer the following packages from their website
![image](/images/posts/blue_apron_packages.png) This is their main Business
and already one could find numerous criticisms about this. It is so inflexible,
what happens if people change their needs during the week e.g. They want to eat
out more or they want to cook at home more? That is just the tip of the iceberg
we could go on whether the food will even suite everyone (how about people on
diets?)

Blue Apron also has complimentary businesses selling wine and cooking utensils but
there is nothing special about this perhaps these lines of businesses will gain
significance when they grow their brand value more.

## Why this is a bad business
I will only touch on this topic briefly because I am sure one can find a plethora
of articles criticizing this company.
As mentioned before the meal plans are very limited which leads to low customer
retention. The average number of orders per customer is around 4 and this number
has remained steady the last 2 years as shown in this [image](filler).
The inflexibility of its meals can be solved and the solutions are rather clear
but there is a deeper more concerning problem low customer retention may
never be solved because people just sign up because it is new and exciting but
once the novelty wears out they go back to their old routine and habits of eating
out and buying groceries from their local super market. This is analogous to people
signing up for gym membership and after a few months they fall back to their old habits
of lounging on the couch after work instead of going to the gym.

The other obvious issue with this business is that it faces many competitors.
Plated, Hellofresh, freshly, chef'd, Sun Basket. There are also a few that failed;
Sprig, Maple and Munchery. This business is not even profitable yet, if they ever
make profits would can expect many more players to join this game due to the low
barriers to entry. Finally perhaps their biggest threat may be Amazon due to their
acquisition of Whole Foods.

## Business Opportunity
>Our market opportunity is broad, as we believe our customers choose to buy Blue Apron meals instead of shopping at grocery stores, ordering takeout, or eating at restaurants.

(in other words they have the potential to take over the restaurant and grocery market $781.5B-gocery market sales-and $543.1B-Restaurant market sales-according to 2016 euromonitor survey) Approximately 1.2% of grocery market is online and has a CAGR(compound annual growth rate) of 8.5% compared to CAGR of 1.3% for grocery market as a whole. Approximately 2.2% of restaurant market is online with an expected CAGR of 22.6% in the next 3 years compared to broader restaurant market CAGR of 1.6% (beware that in absolute terms the growth in broader market still far exceeds growth in online market $0.8B compared to $10.16B for grocery market case). Also these numbers cannot be validated.
although the CAGR for each market is our "best guess", more than likely the realized numbers will be much different.

## How they are selling themselves
>"Our greatest strength is our highly collaborative and multidisciplinary team, which includes agricultural scientists, software and industrial engineers, data scientists, brand and direct marketers, quality and fulfillment associates, operations specialists, photographers, customer experience representatives, recipe writers, and world-class chefs. Our shared commitment to making home cooking accessible to everyone defines our work and focuses our efforts."

>"we have delivered over 159 million meals to households across the United States, which represents approximately 25 million paid orders."

I am unsure how to interpret this one, it would appear that they have given 83.33% of their meals for free

>Growth Strategy
-Increase market penetration with our core product (more customers)
-Expand our core product to fit more lifestyles./Broaden our product portfolio./Develop new brands and new channels. (Create more stuff that is different)
-International expansion (might want to deliver to all states in US first)

>Strengths:
-Powerful and emotional brand connection
-Superior products at compelling values.
-Constant product innovation. : new recipes and ingredients (is that innovation or are just changing the product?) [innovation to me means a new way of doing things that results in an improvement]
-Attractive unit economics.  
-Hard-to-replicate value chain: substantial investments in direct supplier relationships
-Proprietary technology and data.
-Expertise across diverse competencies.

## Reason this stock could be a good investment
Perhaps their business is terrible but we want to make money and so we will
examine why this stock could be a good buy.

They revised their IPO stock price down considerably from $15-$17 to $10 most
likely due to lack of investor confidence. The pessimism of investors could lead to an
undervaluation  

Incredible growth since inception ![image](/images/posts/blue_apron_growth.png)
They are able to continually attract new customers however customer retention
are remained stable which may confirm our hypothesis that people see this just
as a fad.

Dominant market share of meal kit delivery industry right now perhaps they could retain this going forward since they have access to more capital than anyone else especially after this IPO. Since the industry they are in is projected to grow at a phenomenal rate in the next 5 years it could be argued that they are in the best position to capture this.

## Closing thoughts
Blue Apron is a highly competitive business where the product could potentially
be a fad. Survival of the business will depend largely on whether Mr. Salzberg
can steer the ship past the treacherous waters they face in the coming years.
