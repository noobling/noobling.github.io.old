title: Beginner's luck
---

Observe the following statement. It has been proven empirically that beginners
have more success gambling compared to older gamblers. In other words they
had more wins when they first started gambling compared to later.

We must consider the silent evidence in this case. If we looked at a sample of
gamblers, we may find that this gambler's luck does occur. But we should also
consider non gambler's as well. Because if someone is successful gambling there
is a higher chance that they will become a gambler hence we will observe
beginner's luck more frequently in the gamblers population relative to the
general population.

The above case highlights the importance of the need to consider silent evidence.
This idea was first introduced to me in the book The Black Swan.
