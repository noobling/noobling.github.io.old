title: Thoughts on Bitcoin
---

I follow the general consensus that Bitcoin is currently in a bubble although my view of it is biased since I already sold all my Bitcoins. Obviously I feel terrible since I only sold it a few months ago when the price was only $4000 USD.
![image](/images/posts/bitcoin_chart.png) Most people kick themselves for not buying bitcoins earlier and others are sad that they sold too early however if we look at the situtation rationally then one should be quite satisfied with the fact that they sold early or never bought in.

Generally when we look at something that has occured we only look at the scenario that unfolded. In our case it was bitcoin hitting $20,000 USD. But I think we should also analyse the other possible scenarios that never occured. **Just because the price of bitcoin reached $20,000 USD doesn't mean it was the most likely scenario**.

Lets look at an example to explain this, imagine you have never played Blackjack before and you walk into a casino. You sit down at the Blackjack table and place down $10,000 USD. The dealer follows you and places $10,000 USD. You get dealt your cards and you get an Ace and a Jack, the dealer on the other hand busts so you walk away with $20,000 USD. Now the outcome was that you came out with $20,000 but was that a good idea to bet so much money on a game where the odds are against you? Clearly not, and I think the same logic applies to Bitcoin.

Sure the price has increased a tremendous amount, but was that the most likely scenario that was going to unfold 8 years ago? Obviously not it was an untested piece of software with an unknown creator that was difficult to understand. Who would have thought that it would attract main stream attention.

But is it worth investing? It is not something that you would want to pour your life savings into but it is worth some money. Why? well I like to look at this as an option. Most likely you will have a negative payoff but there is a small chance that you will get a very large payoff. It makes sense then to place a small amount in a sum which you are willing to lose. Of course one should also look at opportunity cost. Is Bitcoin really an option you should buy? That is difficult to determine.

I guess one could draw the comparision between Gold and Bitcoin and say that any price is really justified as long as other people agree with you. That is true in some sense but there is really no reason for the price to continue to rise. Prices are driven by supply and demand in an open market and if we look at the what is driving the demand, that is what concerns most. People are not buying Bitcoin to store their money safely they are buying it with the expectation that it will rise, they don't care about the reason behind it. This is dangerous because if it stops rising then they will start pulling their money out and that is when everything falls apart.

Personally I struggle to see the value of Bitcoin, what is the point of it? What is the value that it will add to society? I can't see the big impact that is  promised by it. People are irrational and our brains have not adapted to our current surroundings. Our brains are in the cave man age but we are living in the digital age.
