    It is heart warming to see a company disrupt the world for the better.
    I also like it when someone does not follow the norm as you can see the
    web design is a bit different to what we are used to seeing. Perhaps this
    design might be copied by other websites. (Although it is possible that they
    could have copied this design from somewhere else.)
